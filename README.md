Features
Backtesting: Evaluate the performance of SMA trading strategies over historical data.
Parameter Optimization: Automatically find the best SMA parameters for optimal trading performance.
Performance Metrics: Compute and compare strategy returns with a buy-and-hold approach.
Plotting: Visualize the cumulative returns and strategy performance with detailed plots.
Timing: Measure and report the execution time for optimization
